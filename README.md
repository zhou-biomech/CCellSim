# CCellSim V1.0

An Efficient Multi-scale Simulation Environment for Collective Cell Migration

CCellSim is an software tool that integrates a collective cell migration simulator, visualization output, and data analysis functionality. It is built in portable object-oriented MATLAB and is accessible to other researchers who have experience in high-level programming environments. The simulator is mainly composed of two classes: Cell and Molecule. All properties of these two classes are defined in the script `/src/Cell.m` and `/src/Molecule.m`, respectively.
